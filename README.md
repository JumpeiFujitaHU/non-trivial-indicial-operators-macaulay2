# non-trivial-indicial-operators-macaulay2
### Usage:
nonTrivialIndicialOperators(A,b,w)
### Inputs:
- A, a d×n homogenious integer matrix,
- b, a list, parameter vector,
- w, a list, weight vector
### Output:
- an ideal in $QQ[θ_1..θ_n]$, generated by the non-trivial indicial operators of the GKZ-hypergeometric system $H_A(b)$ with respect to the weight vector $w$, where $θ_i = x_i\partial_i$.
### Assumptions:
This function is designed for $(A,b,w)$ satisfying the following conditions:
1. The indicial ideal of $H_A(b)$ with respect to $w$ is different from the fake indicial ideal of $H_A(b)$ with respect to $w$.
2. There exists a standard pair of the monomial ideal $\mathrm{in}_w(I_A)$ that is associated to $b$.
   Here $I_A$ is the toric ideal of $A$, and $\mathrm{in}_w(I_A)$ is the initial ideal of $I_A$ with respect to $w$.
